# Webscraping using Puppeteer

The node library puppeteer is able to webscrape data from any website. 
Here i used the puppeteer module to webscrape data from myntra to return the images of products which are returned on searching for the keyword "blue cardigan". 

Use headless: False 
     to see the webpage open and navigate to the search bar.
